Well today's been a nice. The workday was fine, had a lot of good conversations with some coworkers, both new and old. Also, out of all the days, this is probably the best day out of the week.

Friday baby.

Sometimes I'm already pretty stressed  by the time Saturday comes around. I mean at that point the next day is already Sunday, and I mean once it's Sunday the afternoon will be a total toss because that next morning will be given up to the perpetual forced servitude we call work.

Don't get me wrong, the 9-5 lifestyle in Western countries during the 21st Century is probably the cushiest form of servitude that has existed thus far.

But it's servitude nonetheless. If you're lucky, your job consists of something that you enjoy (initially). If you're unlucky, it is something that you absolutely hate. Either way, you have to do something for a majority of the week as the only other option is eventual homelessness. Which is a hole that is pretty hard to dig out of. I mean so yeah the average citizen in a capitalist society has it a lot better than most humans that have passed by, it still seems to be that same game of survival of the fittest with a few extra steps.

Either way it isn't Saturday, tomorrow isn't Sunday, because it is F R I D A Y.

I'm in bed, with a person that I love, writing a post without having to worry about the rat race I'm compelled to compete in.

Okay maybe I'm still worrying. But I'm worrying *less*

And that's good. Well better. It's all relative.
