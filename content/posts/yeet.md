Just make it a habit to do yeet.

Just print yeet.

The moment you are in a hello world equivalent tutorial for any sort of technology don't be lazy. If you have the opportunity to change something, as simple as the string that you're printing, do it. It'll make you interact with the software. If you change some fundamental paths or files, you will have to make a handful of edits as a consequence as you follow the tutorial. 

This could cause you to have to debug, as opposed to doing a git clone and then just figuring out how to run the application.

This could cause everything to break and then you spend 3 hours trying to fix it only to git clone the example repo and never figure out why just changing the title from "My Blog" to "Yeet" broke the damn thing.

Yeah that sucks. But you're still better off than just mindlessly running a program. Leave that to the user who still manages to mess it up. The user is much better than you at that. You're in the minority where you have to worry about how and why it runs the way it runs. You have to pretend that you know how it all works down to the "[physics of it](https://youtu.be/FYJ1dbyDcrI?t=154)".

And you won't ever truly understand. There will always be a layer of abstraction lower to explore. There will always be complexity that grows just due to development both on the hardware and software side. You can't tread open water forever, but you can definitely draw a picture of a lifeboat on the way down:

Change "Hello World" to "Yeet".

Don't make an encyclopedia, make a yeetopedia.

A grocery list app to learn Electron?

Nah a daily yeet app.

Just change it so you can lie to yourself more confidently when you said you learned something.
