Well today's been a nice. The workday was fine, had a lot of good conversations with some coworkers, both new and old. Also, out of all the days, this is probably the best day out of the week.

Friday baby.

Sometimes I'm already pretty stressed  by the time Saturday comes around. I mean at that point the next day is already Sunday, and I mean once it's Sunday the afternoon will be a total toss because that next morning will be given up to the perpetual forced servitude we call work.

Don't get me wrong, the 9-5 lifestyle in Western countries during the 21st Century is probably the cushiest form of servitude that has existed thus far.

But it's servitude nonetheless. If you're lucky, your job consists of something that you enjoy (initially). If you're unlucky, it is something that you absolutely hate. Either way, you have to do something for a majority of the week as the only other option is homelessness. .
